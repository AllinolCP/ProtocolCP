# ProtocolCP

ProtocolCP is an open-source, easy to use and free tool for CPPS Developers.
You will find almost every handler (AS2 & AS3) for Club Penguin.
The reason I created this is because a lot of users don't even know the packet-side of Club Penguin.
ProtocolCP will be updated weekly.
The crumbs are from icer.ink and the PCL files are given by Jackson.

What you need:
* Python 2.7
